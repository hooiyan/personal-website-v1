First of all, I would like to dedicate my first post talking about the process of building up my personal site. It is still under progress for some parts like the tags page or the TOC for the blog post, etc. _(which is not really important at the moment)_. However, all the main stuff is ready to be published. Therefore I think it's about time to put this thing out to the world. Else it would be pretty useless to keep procrastinating...

## The purpose (Why)

You might be wondering why not just use **WordPress** or anything like that? That way you can get up and running quickly than start everything from scratch. Well. I've never built a portfolio site before, so this is a great opportunity for me to **try things out**. I need a portfolio site to showcase my skills/ projects as I have no formal education in Computer Science. I also wanted to get **hands-on experience** from phase to phase. Things like getting a domain name/ how to design a website/ where to host the website, etc.

## The idea (What & When)

I wanted a place on the internet to represent myself. Excluding social media. **A year ago**, I made [this](https://hoehooiyan.github.io/cv/) and [this](https://hoehooiyan.github.io/website/) when I was following the [Web Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy. At that time, I imagined myself to have a _real_ website of mine someday. **A year later**, my dream came true. It is amazing to think of how much one can learn over the span of a year.

## The steps (How)

I started taking learning Gatsby seriously during CNY this year _(around the end of January)_. The number one resource I would recommend to get started is [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&ab_channel=AndrewMead) by Andrew Mead.

After that, I first created a repo for this project. But then I deleted it as I have messed up everything when I decided to change my design. LMAO. So I created a new repo and it stays safe until now. Thank God!

### Things to consider

1. How do I want my website to look like?
2. What tech stack to choose?
3. What are the features need to be included?

Basically everything needs to be **planned enough** in the first place. At least I myself need to have something to be structured first. **Doing things with purposes** in mind will definitely help me in the long run.

Be it wireframing or just sketching out the ideas that we already have in mind. These things need not to be _perfect_. They need to be sufficient for us to go into the next step.

**To be honest**, I didn't have a sufficient plan until I realised that's a problem for me. Since I was starting from scratch, I can be pretty creative to create however I want it to be. That's a problem to me as well. I need to set a scope for myself to focus on. I kept changing my design, only decided to use the current one.

This is what I learned.

> Planning comes before coding.

### Design

1. [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd.html)
2. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
3. [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio)
4. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)

**Adobe XD** is the first UI/UX design tool that I used.

**Figma** is the one that we can access on the web. You can also get the css code right away with your design.

**InVision Studio** looks elegant to me. Their website looks really cool.

**Sketch** is the one I won't be able to use till I have a macOS machine.

I've tried out the first 3 and I love Adobe XD the most because I feel more comfortable working with it. Any tools should work, we just need to choose one and start working instead of thinking which one is the best.

### Responsive design

Since there are more and more mobile users right now, I prefer to design the UI with mobile-first approach than the desktop-first approach. Both are equally important, but we still have to choose one over another.

**Mobile-first design** - of course looking good on smaller screens, you might feel empty if there's not much content to show on larger screens. Because we limit the content while designing for smaller screens.

**Desktop-first design** - of course looking good on larger screens, you might feel everything begins to cramp together if the screen sizes go down. Because we normally put more content on larger screens.

> Either way is great as long as you understand and clear about what information you want to convey to your audience.

## The stack behind

This site is powered by [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'm using React and still learning it most of the time for now, that's why I chose **Gatsby** over the other static site generators. The documentation is great and everything is just one google away. I particularly love one of the plugins (**gatsby-image**) which helps optimizing images in different ways. [Check this out](https://using-gatsby-image.gatsbyjs.org/) to see the demo.

I decided to use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) when I first created this repo, but I've changed to **Chakra UI** at the end of the day. I wanted a more organized & consistent way for styling, but I don't have my own design system. Chakra UI is a React component library which I can use all the components that have been created by [Segun Adebayo](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo). For VueJs developer, there is a version of [Chakra UI Vue](https://vue.chakra-ui.com/) coming out recently. Chakra UI makes theme toggling easier for me, so I made this site a dark theme too! I ended up liking the dark theme more!!! üòç

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) was my first choice to manage my blog post. It is simpler than to use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) in my opinion. I migrated to **MDX** since it is not supported by Netlify CMS _yet_. MDX is a new way to write markdown. We can write JSX in the markdown, and use our existing components inside of MDX or just create a new one if we want.

I store all my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hoehooiyan/portfolio) and link it to **Netlify**. Everytime I push an update, it will activate a build process and deploy my website. I can choose to lock the publishing to any deploy. In that way, I can still push my updates while not affecting the website in production.
