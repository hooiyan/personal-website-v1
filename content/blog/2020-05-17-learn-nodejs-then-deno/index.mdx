## How I met Deno

If you are on Twitter, you may have noticed that [Deno v1.0](https://deno.land/v1) is out recently. I don't know its existence until I saw all the tweets around. Since then, I become very sensitive to the word _Deno_.

The day after, I saw the archive of the stream broadcasted live on Twitch by [Coding Garden with CJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67N2yXN_b_E&t=2666s&ab_channel=CodingGardenwithCJ) on YouTube and clicked on that immediately. It's interesting to watch along to learn how an experienced developer learning a new technology.

My first impression about Deno is the dinosaur logo. It looks super cute with the rain behind it. The domain name is telling me like: **Welcome to the dinosaur land!**

There's another resource worth mentioning here, which is the [Deno handbook](https://flaviocopes.com/deno/) written by [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/). It is a nice and short introduction to Deno with just 46 pages.

_More importantly, we always need to go back to the official documentation_.

Deno has one main difference from Node.js which it does not include `package.json` in our project. Instead we will need to import all the packages we need from the url.

Like so:

```javascript
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.50.0/http/server.ts';
```

## Learn Node.js

After spending some hours experiencing with Deno, I decided to learn Node.js starting from today. I began with the [Node.js beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp) from The Net Ninja. I've been trying to learn it last year. There's nothing makes sense to me at that time. I feel like I can now resonate with these ideas. I'm going to build something out with Node.js after I learn all the fundamentals.

## Then Deno

Am I going to learn Deno as well? Yeah, definitely, at some point. But before that, let me be friends with TypeScript first! Because Deno supports TypeScript out of the box! I am so excited to learn all of the unknowns. Deno is just a cute 2-year-old boy now. I hope to see his growth and participate in his life.

**Happy learning!**
