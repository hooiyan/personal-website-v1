Yesterday, I began my journey to study Computer Science with the first subject namely _Programming_, suggested by [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). Below is a list of resources & tools I use in this course.

## Resources

- Video: [Brian Harveyâ€™s SICP lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)
- Textbook: [Structure and Interpretation
  of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-1.html)
- Textbook exercises solutions: [SICP solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions)

## Tools

- Download the IDE - [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/)
- Install packages - [simply-scheme](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/simply-scheme) and [sicp](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/sicp)

### Install packages in DrRacket

1. Fire up **DrRacket** after installing on your computer
2. Click on **File** and select **Package Manager**
3. Click on the tab **Do What I Mean**
4. Type the package name in the **Package Source** textbox and press enter

### Usage of the package

1. Choose **Determine language form source** at the bottom left of DrRacket
2. Replace the word **racket** in `#lang racket` to the package name
3. For example: `#lang simply-scheme`

We can either use REPL or the text editor in DrRacket to run our code. Normally we'll be using REPL when we have less code to write and want to see the result faster. Other than that, we'll write our code in the text editor and run the code later on.

**That's all for now.** This is just a basic guide for me to refer in the future. Also, I hope it is useful for those who want to get started teaching themself computer science as well.
