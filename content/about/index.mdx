## About me

Hey there, I'm flattered if you are reading this.

My name is **Hooi Yan**. I live in Johor, Malaysia. A passionate & proactive lifelong learner and aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer. I have been teaching myself to code since April 2019 and currently specialize in **Front-End Development**.

My current focus is [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). I always keen to learn more. Things move incredibly fast in this industry. Though I can't keep up-to-date with every single piece of technology, I'm willing to learn if there is a need. There is a couple of topics/ technologies I would like to dive into:

1. **Design system**
2. **Testing**
3. [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org/)
4. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
5. [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
6. [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

## A little more

There are 2 statements I read through on [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

> **Type 1 engineers** find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers.

> **Type 2 engineers** typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.

I have been wanting to learn Computer Science along with [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) for a while. This would take **at least 2.5 years** if I spend an hour a day studying all the 9 subjects. You can read my blog to know more as I will soon start to record the journey to become a CS Master. ðŸ˜œ

## More personal

If you don't see me coding, I'm probably _practicing_ piano or _cooking_ with my mum. I am a renal transplant recipient who is forever grateful for the second chance of living a _normal_ life again. ðŸ¥°
